# Weather Detector App

A simple weather detector application developed using Python and Django.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a practice during a learning journey to develop a basic weather detector app. It allows users to search for weather information of a specific city and displays details such as temperature, pressure, and humidity.

## Project Demo
                                             https://github.com/Farahat612/Simple-Weather-Detector/assets/67427124/2d416fe4-0a09-4e77-aa0b-ff9758445a1d


## Project Structure

The project consists of the following directories and files:

1. **weatherdetector** - The main project directory.
   - `asgi.py` - ASGI configuration for the project.
   - `settings.py` - Django settings and configurations for the project.
   - `urls.py` - URL configuration for the project.
   - `wsgi.py` - WSGI configuration for the project.

2. **weather** - The app directory for managing weather-related functionality.
   - `admin.py` - Configuration for Django admin panel.
   - `apps.py` - Configuration for the app.
   - `models.py` - No models are defined in this app.
   - `tests.py` - Unit tests for the app.
   - `urls.py` - URL configuration for the app.
   - `views.py` - Views and logic for retrieving weather information.

3. **templates** - Directory containing HTML templates for rendering the views.
   - `index.html` - Template for rendering the weather detector interface.

4. `manage.py` - Django's command-line utility for managing the project.

## Usage

To run the Weather Detector app locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Set up the project environment and database settings in `settings.py`.

3. Apply database migrations using the command: `python manage.py migrate`

4. Run the development server using the command: `python manage.py runserver`

5. Access the weather detector application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Features

1. **Search for Weather**: Users can search for weather information of a specific city by entering the city name in the search field.

2. **Display Weather Details**: The app retrieves the weather details from an API and displays them on the interface. The displayed information includes the country code, coordinates, temperature, pressure, and humidity.

## Important Code Files

1. **urls.py** - This file in the `weather` app configures the URL pattern for the weather application, mapping it to the corresponding view.

2. **views.py** - The `views.py` file in the `weather` app contains the logic for handling the weather detector views. It includes the `index` view, which retrieves weather information based on user input.

3. **templates** - The `templates` directory contains the HTML template used for rendering the weather detector interface. The `index.html` template displays the search form and shows the weather details when available.
